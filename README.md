<h1> Snake Game

<h4>This is a Java implementation of the classic Snake game. The game uses the Java Swing framework for the user interface and the game logic is implemented in the GamePanel class.

<h1>How to play
<h4>The goal of the game is to eat as many apples as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's body. The snake moves continuously in the direction set by the player.
